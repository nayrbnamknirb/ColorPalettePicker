# Color Palette Picker

This is a final project from my WEB 3350 class that makes use of react and the color npm package to simulate a website like [adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/). It does not have an edited color space like the website and uses the default RGB color space.

The website can be previewed (in a non-functional state) at https://colorpalettepickerapp.netlify.app/
